# CryptoClustering

## Project Description
This project focuses on clustering cryptocurrencies based on market data. By using unsupervised learning, this will predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## File Structure
CryptoClustering is the main directory. Inside it, you will find the following files and folders:
- Resources: Contains the file crypto_market_data.csv
- .gitignore
- Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
- README.md

## Usage
To run the project, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

pip install pandas hvplot scikit-learn

To view and interact with the project, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where Crypto_Clustering.ipynb is located.
3. Run the command `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter notebook server.
4. In your web browser, open the link provided by Jupyter notebook.
5. Click on `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` to open the notebook.
6. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.

The Jupyter notebook will show visualizations of the clustered cryptocurrencies based on market data.
